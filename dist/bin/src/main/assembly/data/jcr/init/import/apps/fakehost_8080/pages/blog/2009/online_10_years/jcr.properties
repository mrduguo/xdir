_overview=It was 10 years ago when I build my <a href="http://duguo.org/archives/1999">first verion</a> of personal homepage in 1999. I am doing the same again today, can you believe this\!\n\
\n\
I was remember at that time I don't have my own computer. I failed two exams on the beginning of 1999 because spend too much time in computer labs. That kind of crazy time was passed away as grow up, but I still keep a strong interest for the new things especial related to internet. It looks like the right direction today, internet is everywhere, and I am part of it in term of life or career.\n\
\n\
There are two goals of my personal homepage. First would be share the information with family, friends or stranger. It's common for most of the other personal homepage. Second, my personal homepage will reflect my latest practice on web technologies. I rebuild homepage every year when I was in university from 1999 to 2004. And another version based on MediaWiki in 2007. The trend for my homepage is from static to more dynamic. This version of homepage is based on my personal project XDir, lastest practice on OSGi and JCR. Because it's build on an extensible architeture, I can see it will live much longer time than previous verions.\n\
